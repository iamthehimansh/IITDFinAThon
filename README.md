## Finathon Hackathon GitHub Repository for 5G Only

Welcome to the Finathon Hackathon! This is the GitHub repository dedicated to your team's project. In order to participate in the hackathon and submit your work, you'll need to follow these simple steps to push your project to this repository.

### How to Submit Your Project

1. **Clone the GitHub Repository:**
   - First, make sure you have Git installed on your local machine. If not, you can download and configure it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

   - Open your terminal or command prompt.

   - Use the following command to clone your team's repository to your local machine:

     ```
     git clone <repository_url>
     ```

   Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of your team's private repository.

2. **Copy Your Project Files:**
   - Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the newly created folder (usually named after your repository).

   - Copy all of your project files and directories into this folder.
  
   - Create a .gitignore file and add it.

3. **Stage and Commit Your Changes:**
   - In your terminal, navigate to the repository folder:

     ```
     cd <repository_folder_name>
     ```

   Replace `<repository_folder_name>` with the actual name of your repository folder.

   - To stage all your changes, run:

     ```
     git add .
     ```

   - Now, commit your changes with a meaningful message describing your update:

     ```
     git commit -m "Added project files for Finathon hackathon"
     ```

4. **Push Your Changes to GitHub:**
   - Finally, push your local changes to the GitHub repository:

     ```
     git push
     ```

   You may be prompted to log in with your GitHub credentials if you haven't done so previously.

5. **Confirmation:**
   - After successfully pushing your changes, you have now submitted your project for the Finathon Hackathon.

Your project will be available for review by the hackathon organizers after this is completed. Good luck, and may the best project win!

If you encounter any issues or have questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to the hackathon organizers for assistance. Happy coding!
